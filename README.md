## Installing via npm

The client is distributed via **npm**:

```bash
 npm install rabbitmq-amqp-js-client
```

## Getting started

Inside the [_examples_](./examples/) folder you can find a node project that shows how to use the library.

### Connecting to a virtual host

By default the client connects to the default virtual host `/`. Set the optional `virtualHost` parameter to connect to a different one:

```js
const environment = rabbit.createEnvironment({
  host: "localhost",
  port: 5672,
  username: "guest",
  password: "guest",
  virtualHost: "my-vhost",
})
```

RabbitMQ selects the virtual host of an AMQP 1.0 connection through the `hostname` field of the `open` frame, using the `vhost:<name>` convention (see the [RabbitMQ AMQP 1.0 documentation](https://www.rabbitmq.com/docs/amqp#virtual-hosts)).

Over TLS this does not affect the server name sent for SNI: `virtualHost` only sets the `open` frame `hostname`, while the TLS server name is still derived from `host`.

When the virtual host does not exist, or the user has no permission on it, the broker closes the socket without sending an AMQP error frame. The promise returned by `createConnection` is rejected in that case, so the connection attempt fails rather than hanging.

## Roadmap

The interface shall be uniformed to all other clients in order to have [unified documentation](https://www.rabbitmq.com/client-libraries/amqp-client-libraries). While developing, keep in mind the support for **autoreconnect**.

1. Implement the management functions via AMQP

   - "REST style" send message
   - handling `senderLink`, `receiverLink`
   - generating exchanges, queues, bindings

2. Implementing **connections**

3. Implementing **environment**

4. Provide simple APIs for [publishing and consuming](https://www.rabbitmq.com/client-libraries/amqp-client-libraries#publishing)

5. (OPTIONAL) Autoreconnect (possibly [already managed by RHEA](https://github.com/amqp/rhea/blob/main/examples/reconnect/client.js))

6. (OPTIONAL) Metrics for **Prometheus**
