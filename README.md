## Installing via npm

The client is distributed via **npm**:

```bash
 npm install rabbitmq-amqp-js-client
```

## Getting started

Inside the [_examples_](./examples/) folder you can find a node project that shows how to use the library.

## Consumer flow control

By default the client relies on [rhea](https://github.com/amqp/rhea)'s credit window (1000 credits), so up to 1000
messages can be delivered to a consumer before any of them is settled. If your consumers process messages slowly, you
can bound the number of unsettled messages held by a consumer with `initialCredits`, similar to `basic.qos` (prefetch)
in AMQP 0.9.1 and to `initialCredits` in the
[other RabbitMQ AMQP 1.0 clients](https://www.rabbitmq.com/client-libraries/amqp-client-libraries):

```typescript
const consumer = await connection.createConsumer({
  queue: { name: "my-queue" },
  initialCredits: 10, // at most 10 unsettled messages delivered to this consumer
  messageHandler: (context, message) => {
    // ... process the message ...
    context.accept() // settling the message grants one more credit to the broker
  },
})
consumer.start()
```

Every time a message is settled (`accept`, `discard` or `requeue`) one credit is granted back to the broker, so the
consumer never holds more than `initialCredits` unsettled messages. For pre-settled consumers (`preSettled: true`)
messages are settled on arrival, so `initialCredits` bounds the number of in-flight messages instead.

## Roadmap

The interface shall be uniformed to all other clients in order to have [unified documentation](https://www.rabbitmq.com/client-libraries/amqp-client-libraries). While developing, keep in mind the support for **autoreconnect**.

1. Implement the management functions via AMQP

   - "REST style" send message
   - handling `senderLink`, `receiverLink`
   - generating exchanges, queues, bindings

2. Implementing **connections**

3. Implementing **environment**

4. Provide simple APIs for [publishing and consuming](https://www.rabbitmq.com/client-libraries/amqp-client-libraries#publishing)

5. (OPTIONAL) Autoreconnect (possibly [already managed by RHEA](https://github.com/amqp/rhea/blob/main/examples/reconnect/client.js))

6. (OPTIONAL) Metrics for **Prometheus**
